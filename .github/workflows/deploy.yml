          # Only copy necessary files/folders to avoid overwriting .env or excessive data transfer
          # However, a simple git pull is often better if we aren't building artifacts in CI.
          # Since the user was doing "git pull" on server, let's stick to the "Remote Command" pattern using ssh-action.
          # The SCP action is optional if we trust git pull. Let's stick to the user's current flow: GIT PULL on server.
          # It's cleaner for now. I will rewrite this step to just be SSH.
